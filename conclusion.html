<p class="page_title">Financial Learning Conclusions</p>

<p>Our unsupervised learning models demonstrated that there were four important classes, one of which was dominant, containing the majority of companies. We also demonstrated that most companies stayed within a single class over a ten year period but there were some companies that switched classes from year to year. Apple, for example, was a member of eight different classes over the past decade.</p>

<p>When we applied a singular value decomposition, we found that component number two correlated very strongly with class, and that singular value decomposition was useful when applied to raw data.</p>

<p>Our supervised learning models involved two trained classifiers and produced consistent results in the top features that impacted the current year’s market capitalization.</p>

<p>The regression analysis ran its own classifier to identify the top 10-k variables affecting next year’s market capitalization. Using both the Supervised Learning features and a Random Forest classifier for next year’s market cap relations, we discovered that the model using non-normalized data correctly identified 56% of companies as increasing or decreasing in market capitalization.</p>

<p>Our overall conclusion was that machine learning, in combination with regression analysis, could be a very valuable source of information to investors.</p>
